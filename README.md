# Vehical Number Plate Detection

I have submitted this code for TCS_HumAin on the topic "Number plate detection"


# Files

In these, 
DetectPlates - which is used to detect the plates from the original image.
CharacterDetection - It is used to identify the character present in the given image.(It uses **TensorFlow has a backend** ) to detect the character from the image.


## FrameWork and Libraries used

 - NumPy
 - Tensorflow
 - Keras
 - OpenCV(Library)
 
 ## Steps

 1. First open the file Main.py and feed the images with the file path
    in the line 114 and run the file. 
    
 2. Then it use TensorFlow has a
    backend it first identify the license plate and detect the
    characters from it.
    
## Installing library

 - pip install opencv-python (This command installs a OpenCV and Numpy)
 - pip install tensorflow
 - pip install Keras
